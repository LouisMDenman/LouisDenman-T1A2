        <h1>TOURISM MEDIA</h1>
        <p> From February to April 2020, I had the pleasure of being able to learn from and shadow the developer team at Tourism Media, 
            with intentions of gaining enough skill through learning at work as well as from university to become a member of the team.
            Tourism Media has been in business since 1992, creating, promoting and optimising content for the likes of the biggest 
            companies in the tourism industry such as Expedia, FlightCentre, WotIf, etc. Whilst my time learning was cut short, I cannot
            thank founding partners Nick and Matt enough for having me, and in that short amount of time I got fantastic experience of
            industry.
        </p>
