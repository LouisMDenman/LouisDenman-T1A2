        <h1>MY CODING JOURNEY</h1>
        <p> My coding experience began in high school, when I first had to learn in a compulsory technology class from year 7-8. Following
            this, I thoroughly enjoyed all things IT, and took the elective IT subject provided from years 9-12, and finished year 12 in 
            2019 with a VHA 10 (A+). 
        </p>
        <p> In 2020, I commenced tersiary education at the University of Queensland, undertaking a Bachelor of Science/IT. At the time my
            main pursuit was to get into postgraduate medicine, however, I chose the dual degree as an undergraduate because I enjoyed the
            relevant subjects in high school. After 2 years within that degree, I knew that the science route wasn't for me, and I switched
            to a Bachelor of IT. Over the following 2 years I continued to study a blend of full-time and part-time semesters along with
            a deffered semester in between. Due to a multitude of reasons, I decided to end my time at UQ at the end of 2023, and instead
            pursue Coder Academy's Web Development Bootcamp in 2024.
