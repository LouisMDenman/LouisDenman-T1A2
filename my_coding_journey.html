        <h1>MY CODING JOURNEY</h1>
        <p> My coding experience began in high school when I first had to learn HTML, CSS and Python in a compulsory technology class from 
            years 7-8. Following this, I thoroughly enjoyed all things IT, and took the elective IT subject provided from years 9-12, and
            finished year 12 in 2019 with a VHA 10 (A+). 
        </p>
        <p> In 2020, I commenced tertiary education at the University of Queensland, undertaking a Bachelor of Science/IT. At the time my
            main pursuit was to get into postgraduate medicine, however, I chose the dual degree as an undergraduate because I enjoyed the
            relevant subjects in high school. After 2 years of undertaking that degree, I knew that the science route wasn't for me, and I
            switched to a Bachelor of IT. Over the following 2 years, I continued to study a blend of full-time and part-time semesters along
            with a deferred semester in between. 
        </p>
        <p> Due to a multitude of reasons, I decided to end my time at UQ at the end of 2023. My goal was still to get into the IT industry,
            and as mentioned in my work experience page, I have to once again greatly thank Tourism Media, and specifically one of the co-founders,
            Matt. When I was lost at what the next step was, he gave me a great deal of advice and possible routes to take in the future, as well as
            welcomed me to come around to the office and speak to his developers about their experience and advice. Through personal research, I was
            looking into the Coder Academy's boot camp, and some previous students who now work at Tourism Media couldn't praise it more, ultimately
            resulting in my enrolment in the course, the creation of this portfolio and where I am at now!
