        <h1>BAM GARAGE</h1>
        <p> From June to October of 2021, I worked at BAM Garage as a yardhand for the mechanics. Within this role I was responsible for
            many roles involving clients and representing the BAM brand, so as a result greatly improved my customer services skills.
            I thoroughly enjoyed the role due to being exposed some enthusiast as well as luxury cars and getting to work with some great
            people, but ultimately had to give up this role due to working hours being incompatible with full-time study.
        </p>
