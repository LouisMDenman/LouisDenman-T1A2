        <h1>BORAL</h1>
        <h3>CUSTOMER SERVICE AGENT</h3>
        <p> From January 2022 until November 2022, I was a customer service agent (CSA) as part of the boral inbound service center.
            Within this role, CSAs are responsible for servicing customers representing brands such as Metricon, East Coast, John Holland, etc.
            Customers call in an inbound phone queue, and agents create, update, delete and move orders within the system per request. 
            Working this role further developed my customer service skills, greatly increased my performance under pressure, and taught
            me how to use unique applications such as command.
        </p>
        <h3>CONCRETE ALLOCATOR</h3>
        <p> In December 2022, I was fortunate enough to receieve a promotion to the allocations team within the service center, and worked
            in this position until August 2023. As a concrete allocator, I was responsible for managing where the concrete agitators are sent
            within a cluster or area within Southeast Queensland. Doing so requires a great deal of responsibilty and forward planning, as well
            as being able to adapt quickly to any sudden changes such as concrete plants or trucks breaking down. On top of this, priority pours
            are a frequent occurence where large jobs for priority customers use lots of resources and time, and as an allocator the it is your
            responsiblility to make sure all goes well logistically. As a result, I have had the pleasure of being directly responsible for
            managing priority pours for jobs including: East Coast Construction Companies construction of the new brisbane casino; Cross River
            Rails tunnel construction, and the Acciona-Georgio joint venture Coomera Connector project to name a few.
        </p>
        <p> On top of this, for multiple months of this time I learnt and acted as the teams testing allocator. Within this role, the allocator
            was responsible for managing all of the jobs that required concrete testing for the day, as well as generate a report for the next.
            Along with managing all of the jobs for the day, it was the allocators responsibilty to inform the team of approximately 15 testers
            of any changes during the day, and problem solving if any issues are encounted or testing numbers are short.
        </p>
        <p> Within the allocator role, I learned a great deal of skills, and have encountered the most responsibility I've had in my working career
            so far. Working under pressure, managing people, managing resources, and accountability were among the best skills I will take forward
            with me in my career
        </p>
        <h3>CONCRETE TESTER</h3>
        <p> Toward the end of my time as an allocator in the boral service center, I knew that I was enjoying the role, but really long term
            sought a role in some kind of IT development position. Due to this, combined with the fact that I was yet to finish my IT degree 
            at the time, I knew I would have to go from full time work to part time to facilitate study. As a result, from September 2023
            until February 2024, I undertook the role as a concrete tester. Whilst most testers were on the field, I was tasked with transporting
            concrete testing cylinders from the Gold Coast to Brisbane labs, as well as entering data from field sheets of other testers into
            the online system. Working at Boral was fantastic, and they were a great company that treated me well and invested in me. I met many
            great people that I am still friends with, and I experienced only support when announcing my decision to give up work to study for my
            long term career aspirations.
