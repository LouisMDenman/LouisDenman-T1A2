        <h1>KFC</h1>
        <p> KFC started my working career as a casual job that I began working at in high school in 2017. Through 2017-2019 I worked
            1-3 shifts a week as a front of house worker. From 2020-2021, I worked there as a holiday job until it was no longer convenient.
            Below is a letter of recommendation from when I initially believed I was leaving the store, shortly before the covid pandemic hit
            and I was rehired due to moving back home.
