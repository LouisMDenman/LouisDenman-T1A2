        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        <p> As you probably saw from the home page of this website, my name's Louis Denman. I'm an aspiring web development student,
            currently learning through the Coder Academy's 10 month bootcamp, and have made this portfolio as an intial project to demonstrate
            the skills that I have aquired through the course. I've always had a personal interest with all things technology, and when I was
            introduced to coding in my year 7 Information Technology course, I knew it was something that I thoroughly enjoyed and wanted to
            pursue. For more information about my previous coding history, as well as aspirations in the future, see the my coding journey
            section. Otherwise, feel free to have a look below for a few personal interests that I enjoy when I'm not coding!

        <h3>Moutain Biking</h3>
        <p> Although I definitely need to get on the bike more than I have recently, I still really enjoy mountain biking. I've been riding
            since 2014, when I was only 12 years of age on my old hardtail. When I started taking it a bit more seriously, I saved up and 
            got myself a Giant Stance, which was my first dual suspension bike. On this bike I participated in local competitions, and always
            had a great time riding it. In 2017, I upgraded to a Trek Remedy 7, seeing as when I got older I was more interested in hitting
            bigger jumps and harder trails. That same year, however, I went over the handlebars when I came short on a notoriously large local
            gap, and managed to snap my collarbone and completely disrupt my AC joint. Luckily I made a full recovery, but since then I have
            taken it a bit easier, and been lucky enough to ride some awesome spots in Tasmania and New Zealand.

        <h3>Basketball</h3>
        <p> Later in high school I took an interest in basketball; I had mates who were interested and played it and I was frequently watching
            highlight clips from games and liked shooting the ball around at recess. As a result I signed up to play in 2018 at school, and played
            2 years of school and then 2 years of college. Standing at a resoudingly average height, I wasn't too skilled or built for it but always
            had a good time playing with friends.

        <h3>Soccer</h3>
        <p> Soccer has been my longest standing hobby, seeing as I started playing in 2009. I was most serious in high school, commiting to club 
            and school games, participating in preseason and postseason camps to be on top of my game. Through these ventures, I had the pleasure of
            playing soccer next to some great talent of which are now in Germany, Spain and the A-League, as well as meet some friends who I am still
            close with to this day. After my college season in 2021 I have not played, but I am inteding on starting to play again for a local
            club next season.

        <h3>Car Enthusiast</h3>
        <p> Ever since my dad rolled into the driveway with his brand new 2012 Subaru BRZ when I was 10 years old, I was excited about cars. Growing up
            I had a soft spot for all things subaru, mainly BRZs and Hawkeye WRXs, but as I've grown up to this point I have come to appreciate most
            enthusiast vehicles and styles including, JDMs, Euros, American and Australian muscle. After saving up some money towards the end of my P 
            plate lisence, I wanted something fun that was in my budget, and settled on my current car that is pictured below: A subaru liberty. Whilst
            not quite a WRX, this one is a 3.0R Spec B, which came with a similar 6 speed manual transmission and a unique boxer 6 engine.
